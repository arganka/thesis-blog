Detail data: terdapat 12500 loop detector pada 1300 persimpangan jalan.
Interaction techniques: touch pad (pan dan zoom),

<strong>Komentar singkat</strong>
Paper ini menawarkan teknik visualisasi untuk menggambarkan dampak kecelakaan pada kemacetan di suatu kota dengan methapor lingkaran. Sesaat sebelum terjadi kecelakaan, lingkaran akan membesar dan daerah yang diprediksi terkena dampak kemacetan akan di-highlight.

<strong>Inspirasi</strong>
Salah satu artikel awal yang saya temukan saat googling tentang transportation visualization, memberikan ide bahwa visualisasi ternyata bisa berguna (dan digunakan) oleh penentu kebijakan, misalnya city planner.

<strong>Quoted</strong>
<em>On a macro level, Traffic Origins allowed us to observe how traffic incidents vary over the course of a single day. Heavy traffic incidents are predictable clustered around the morning and evening peak hours, accidents in the early morning and late evening and vehicle breakdowns are evenly distributed over the work day.</em>
<em> On a micro level, our visualization gave us the opportunity to observe the visual relationship between traffic incidents and resulting congestion.</em>

<strong>Abstract</strong>
<em>Traffic incidents such as road accidents and vehicle breakdowns are a major source of travel uncertainty and delay, but the mechanism by which they cause heavy traffic is not fully understood. Traffic management controllers are tasked with routing repair and clean up crews to clear the incident and often have to do so under time pres- sure and with imperfect information. To aid their decision making and help them understand how past incidents affected traffic, we propose Traffic Origins, a simple method to visualize the impact road incidents have on congestion. Just before a traffic incident occurs, we mark the incident location with an expanding circle to uncover the underlying traffic flow map and when it ends, the circle recedes. This not only directs attention to upcoming events, but also allows us to observe the impact traffic incidents have on vehicle flow in the immediate vicinity and the cascading effect multiple incidents can have on a road network. We illustrate this technique using road incident and traffic flow data from Singapore.</em>
